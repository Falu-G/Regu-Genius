<section data-identifier="29KLI5T$fDsxIEp5xA5_mt" data-numbered="global" title="Regulation 38"> 
<p data-identifier="06skDT5$13QB_1xTO$UYCh" data-numbered="global">At the completion of a building project the contractor must provide the school management with enough fire safety information to enable them to:</p>
 <ol type="a"> <li> 
<p data-identifier="0CBaieiaH4JhyMmvCgQ$Ga" data-numbered="global">understand and implement the fire safety strategy of the building</p>
 </li>
 <li> 
<p data-identifier="2rIloESurB7h5Vvs5b1Mku" data-numbered="global">maintain any fire safety systems provided in the building</p>
 </li>
 <li> 
<p data-identifier="1qMn3U2716BvnHHRuu6o4p" data-numbered="global">carry out an effective fire risk assessment of the building</p>
 </li>
 </ol>
 
<p data-identifier="3BxMj_jHzC_PqATN85TXCl">Much of this is covered in Regulation 38 of the Building Regulations. However, this is only the beginning. Fire safety management must cover the life of a building and many of the responsibilities for this are set out in the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.</p>
 
<p data-identifier="2PAzlfYtfD5A_k1qqz$LY6" data-numbered="global">Regulation 38 requires that, where building work involves the erection or extension of a relevant building, or a relevant change of use of a building, fire safety information shall be given to the responsible person at the completion of the project or when the building or extension is first occupied.</p>
 
<p data-identifier="2RSPdSLLf6ThjreTVIY67D" data-numbered="global">A 'relevant building' is a building to which the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 applies, or will apply after the completion of building work, and covers most premises. 'Fire safety information' means information relating to the design and construction of the building or extension, and the services, fittings and equipment provided in or in connection with the building or extension which will assist the responsible person to operate and maintain the building or extension with reasonable safety. Responsible person' has the meaning given in Article 3 of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (see section 17 below). A 'relevant change of use' is a material change of use where, after the change of use takes place, the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 will apply, or continue to apply, to the building.</p>
 
<p data-identifier="1eZ6MuT79AHujcojwdMOCm" data-numbered="global">The fire safety information should be given to the responsible person at one of the following times:</p>
 <ol type="a"> <li> 
<p data-identifier="1vTyvSo1T9eOr3M61XKRxF" data-numbered="global">when the project is complete</p>
