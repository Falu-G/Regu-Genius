The fire dampers should close when smoke is detected . In the case of a system that recirculates air , smoke detectors 14 should be fitted in the extract ductwork before the point of separation of the recirculated air and discharge to open air , and before any filters or other air cleaning equipment . Such detectors should cause the system to shut down immediately . Mechanical ventilation , unless specifically designed for smoke extraction , should be shut down as soon as smoke is detected in the duct , or upon operation of the fire alarm . Non-domestic kitchens and plant rooms should have separate and independent extraction systems and the extracted air should not be recirculated .
